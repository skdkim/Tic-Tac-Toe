## About the Game
You already know what this game is, it's Tic Tac Toe. You take turns with
someone or yourself placing pieces on the board. First to get in a row wins.

##Technology
This game was created from Vanilla JS using the React library. Much of the
game logic code can be found on Facebook's tutorial for React.

My contribution was that I simply took what was on their CodePen and split
it up into differnt files. I split the JS files and the CSS files. I also
had webpack piece together everything for me, something CodePen didn't need.
